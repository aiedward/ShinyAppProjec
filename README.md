# ShinyApp Project
ShinyApp Project from Developing Data Products course from Coursera

On my shiny app, the user selects an NBA 3-pt shooter
whom has taken at least 100 3-pt shots in the current 
season (2015-2016). The user can also choose to move the
slider for the minimal shot distance that the 3-pt shots
were taken from.
